# Interpretation Under Heterogeneity

Recall that in the model

$$
Y=X^{\prime} \beta+U
$$

the effect of a change in $$X$$ (say, from $$X=x$$ to $$X=x^{\prime}$$ ) is the same for everybody.

**However, the effect of a change in** $$X$$ **on** $$Y$$ **can be different for different people.** To capture this: allow for $$\beta$$ to be random. When $$\beta$$ is random, we may absorb $$U$$ into the intercept and simply write

$$
Y=X^{\prime} \beta .
$$

## Notation

1. With a random sample where variables are indexed by $$i$$, we would write $$Y_i=X_i^{\prime} \beta_i$$, which makes it explicit that every individual has a unique effect $$\beta_i$$.
2.  Assume $$k=1$$ and write $$D$$ in place of $$X_1$$, which is assumed to take values in $$\{0,1\}$$, . Then,

    $$
    Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 D .
    $$
