# Endogeneity



##

**The endogeneity means that there is correlation between regressor** $$X$$ **and error term** $$U$$**. Means** $$Corr(X,U) \neq 0$$**, this leads to the assumption** $$E[X U]=0$$**.**

There are three scenarios that can leads to endogeneity:

1. Omitted Variable
2. Measurement Error
3. Simultaneity

Now, we are going to talk about these scenarios in detail.

### Omitted Variable



### Measurement Error



### Simultaneity
