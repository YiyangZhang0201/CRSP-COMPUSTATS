# Properties of LS

Let $$(Y, X, U)$$ be a random vector where $$Y$$ and $$U$$ take values in $$\mathbf{R}$$ and $$X$$ takes values in $$\mathbf{R}^{k+1}$$. Assume further that the first component of $$X$$ is a constant equal to one. Let $$\beta \in \mathbf{R}^{k+1}$$ be such that

$$
Y=X^{\prime} \beta+U
$$

We assume that our model satisfies the following conditions:

1. $$E[X U]=0$$
2. $$E\left[X X^{\prime}\right]<\infty$$
3. There is no perfect collinearity in $$X$$

Denote the marginal distribution of $$(Y,X)$$ by $$P$$. And let $$\left(Y_1, X_1\right), \ldots,\left(Y_n, X_n\right)$$ be an i.i.d. sample of random vectors with distribution $$P$$.

And the properties we will discuss next are:

* Bias
* Gauss-Markov Theorem
* Consistency
* Asymptotic Normality

## Bias

**Under the first assumption,** $$E[U \mid X]=0$$ **(i.e.,** $$E[Y \mid X]=X^{\prime} \beta$$**) it follows that** $$E[\hat{\beta}]=\beta$$



## Gauss-Markov Theorem



## Consistency



## Asymptotic Normality
