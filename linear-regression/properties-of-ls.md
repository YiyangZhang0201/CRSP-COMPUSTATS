# Properties of LS

Let $$(Y, X, U)$$ be a random vector where $$Y$$ and $$U$$ take values in $$\mathbf{R}$$ and $$X$$ takes values in $$\mathbf{R}^{k+1}$$. Assume further that the first component of $$X$$ is a constant equal to one. Let $$\beta \in \mathbf{R}^{k+1}$$ be such that

$$
Y=X^{\prime} \beta+U
$$
