# Instrumental Variables

## Instrumental Variables

In order to overcome the difficulty associated with $$E[X U] \neq 0$$ (endogeneity). We assume that there is an additional random vector $$Z$$ taking values in $$\mathbf{R}^{l+1}$$ with $$l+1 \geq k+1$$ such that $$E[Z U]=0$$.

Any exogenous component of $$X$$ is contained in $$Z$$ (the so-called included instruments). In particular, we assume the first component of $$Z$$ is constant equal to one, i.e., $$Z=\left(Z_0, Z_1, \ldots, Z_l\right)^{\prime}$$ with $$Z_0=1$$.

We also assume that $$E\left[Z X^{\prime}\right]<\infty, E\left[Z Z^{\prime}\right]<\infty$$ and that there is no perfect collinearity in $$Z$$.



We can use the IV method to deal with the problem
